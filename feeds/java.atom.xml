However we may not understand it as we should, at least I didn't put more attention on it previously. Lately I found some interview questions about HashMap which are pretty interesting, and I thought it should be a good motivation to know more about HashMap, so that I won't be blocked if challenged in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First let's raise some questions about HashMap, these are asked a lot by interviewers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What's the initial capacity of HashMap?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What's the default load factor of HashMap?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What's the data structure internally used in HashMap?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If create HashMap with code &lt;code&gt;new HashMap&amp;lt;&amp;gt;(20)&lt;/code&gt;, what the size of bucket array should be?&lt;/li&gt;
